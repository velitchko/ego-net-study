                            <b>Network visualizations show connections between entities, called edges and nodes respectively.</b> 
                            Network visualizations are used across application domains.
                            For example, in social network analysis, nodes represent people and edges represent different types of relationships between them.

                            Many different types of such networks exist, such as multivariate networks, multilayer networks, and compound graphs, just to name a few. In this study, however, we are particularly interested in studying so-called <b>ego networks</b>. An ego network represents connections relative to a particular focal node, the so-called <b>ego</b>. In other words: instead of visualizing an entire network, we only visualize nodes and edges important to the ego, i.e. its neighbors, its neighbors' neighbors, etc..

                            However, such <b>ego networks can be represented in many different ways</b>, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. In this study, you will solve six tasks for a particular ego network representation. You will receive more detailed instructions and explanations regarding each representation and task once you start the study.
