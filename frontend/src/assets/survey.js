                            <b>Network visualizations show connections between entities, called edges and nodes respectively.</b> 
                            Network visualizations are used across application domains. For example, in social network analysis, nodes represent people and edges represent their relationship(s), such as colleagues, friends, or lovers. Visualizing networks effectively can assist researchers and laypeople make sense of complex relational data, such as social networks, flight paths, or biochemical interaction networks.
